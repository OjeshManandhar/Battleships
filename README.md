# Battleships

A Battleship game, your goal is to destroy all of the enemy ships.

You lose when all of your ships are destroyed.

### Backstory
Mini project developed for the "OOP through C++" course during the 3<sup>rd</sup> semester, 2074 BS(2017-2018 AD).

### Development
I used **Code::Blocks 17.12** as IDE and compiler on Windows 10.

Tested on Windows 7 but I needed to change the console size as the console is bigger in Win10.

I don't know if it works on Linux distros.....chances are it might not compile at all.
